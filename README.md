# Mario-Bros-Remastered
A 2D platformer game inspired by classic Mario titles, featuring dynamic environments, collectible items, enemies, and multiple game states for immersive gameplay.

## Description
Mario PRO2 is a side-scrolling platformer developed in C++.  
Players can control Mario (and Luigi in multiplayer mode) to collect coins, avoid hazards, defeat enemies, and reach the finish flag.  
The game includes different gameplay phases: pre-game, paused, in-game, and endgame screens with interactive menus.

## Features
- **Dynamic background** that changes based on time of day
- **Multiple objects**: platforms, coins, spikes, mushrooms, goombas, and stars
- **Star mode** with special visual indicators
- **Score and life tracking** for one or two players
- **Pregame, pause, and endgame screens** with navigable menus
- **Smooth rendering** for all in-game objects and UI elements

## Technologies
- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: `pro2::Window` (custom rendering API)
- **Data Structures**: STL containers (vectors, strings, pairs)
- **OOP Design**: Classes for game entities and UI components
